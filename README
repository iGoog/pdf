# The "best" HTML to PDF converter "tool".
pdf's are over 25 years old. Web standards are still evolving, but HTML, css, and ecmascript are nothing new.

This kludge on top of chromium puppeteer, and you may discover it is the best HTML to PDF converter for your needs.
The 20 lines of code are pretty straightforward. It loads a minimalist express server, uses puppeteer to render a
page (chrome), and then tells puppeteer to wait for the page to render and then convert it to a pdf.

# Security
Lock down the url, remove the parameters, run it in a secure environment, firewall it, or
containerize it and limit container resources. YOLO




Fire up npm with
npm start
then convert webpages to a pdf with:
http://localhost:8080/?scale=0.6&url=https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/&chill=0
The url takes 3 parameters:
scale - resize the pdf
url - the url you are printing
chill - wait some extra time in ms to let the browser render
